# Printf-MIPS-Implementation
#### This project was a part of Computer Organization Course at the American University in Cairo (AUC)
This is a mips assembly code to perform the C printf functionality. This code is given a printf statement, then parse it, and outputs its correct output as it would be obtained from a C compiler.

To run the program, MARS MIPS IDE should be used.
